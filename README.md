Setting Up The Movie Database API Key

Movie Page utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data. To test the application, you'll need to obtain your own API key from TMDb.

    Sign up for an account on TMDb.
    After signing in, go to your account settings and navigate to the API section.
    Generate a new API key.
    Once you have your API key, create a new file named .env in the root directory of the project.
    Inside the .env file, add the following line with your API key:

makefile

REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key from TMDb.

Note: Ensure the .env file is in the root directory of the project.

npm run start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
